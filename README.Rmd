# SocialScienceR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SocialScienceR is to create a package that teaches social scientists who are not comfortable with coding how to use R for data analysis and visualization. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of SocialScienceR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("margotdv04/SocialScienceR")
```

## Purpose

SocialScienceR is a package that will teach users how to use R for data analysis and visualization.

## Target Audience

The target audience for SocialScienceR are social scientists who are not comfortable with coding for data analysis.


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#library(SocialScienceR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Proposed R Package

Our proposed R package is what we have described above, a package that teaches social scientists how to use R. We plan to continue this project and expanding its breadth.
